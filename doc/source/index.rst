About
-----

The key value of PseudoNetCDF is netcdf-like access to complex data formats
in the air quality field.

PseudoNetCDF was created to provide netcdf-like (see netCDF4) access air
quality data written in other formats. The interface was designed based on
Scientific.io.netcdf and netcdf4-python. Then it grew to provide meta-data
aware spatial and temporal processing, some inspired by xarray and pandas.
